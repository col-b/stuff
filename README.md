push
====
A basic shell script utility for interacting with the pushbullet service available at pushbullet.com.

The service provides an easy to "push" notifications to your own or someone else's android phone or tablet.  This includes basic things like notes and messages, todo or shopping lists, or more complex things like links and files.  See the pushbullet website for more details

The utility requires bash and curl.  You can get this on Windows with Cygwin, but the script has as yet only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 at that).
